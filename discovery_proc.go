// Discovers namespaces from the /proc filesystem. This discovery runs only
// once in the current PID namespace. The rationale is two-fold: first, we
// already see all processes, even those in child PID namespaces (because PID
// namespaces are not only hierarchical, but also nested). And second, the
// Linux kernel blocks entering parent PID (and user) namespaces; and in
// consequence of this rule, the kernel also blocks entering sibling PID
// namespaces.
//
// See also: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html,
// http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html (clearly spelling out the
// rules), as well as
// http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html (yes, user
// namespaces are also important in the whole game).
