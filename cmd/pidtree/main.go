// The "pidtree" CLI tool shows a simplified process tree, but with the
// following twists: it also shows PID namespaces, and translates PIDs into
// their PID namespace-local versions. In addition, it also allows showing
// only a single branch leading to a specific process/PID in a specific PID
// namespace.
