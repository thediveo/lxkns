/*

Package style styles text output of the CLI commands with foreground and
background colors, as well as different text styles (bold, italics, ...).

Text styling is user-configurable and optionally stored in a YAML file in the
users' home directories as ~/.lxknsrc.yaml.

Additionally, this package provides CLI flags: "--theme" to control the theme
used (dark or light), "--color" for enabling or disabling colorization
(including automatic detection), and "--treestyle" for changing the style of the
ASCII/Unicode tree rendering.
