// This implements central part of the style configuration mechanism: packages
// consuming this package must call AddFlags() after they've created their
// root command, as well as BeforeCommand() before their command executes,
// preferably as PersistentPreRunE of their root command.
//
// Other parts of this package then hook themselves automatically into the two
// phases of flag creation and just-before-command-execution. This helps
// keeping this package more modular.
