The application bar additionally offers these quick-access actions:

- ➋ collapses all tree levels, except for the root level as well as its
  immediate children.
- ➌ expands all tree levels.
- ➍ manual discovery and automatic refresh control. See also [discovery
  refresh](#discovery-refresh).

The sidebar can be closed either by click or tapping the close symbol ➊ or by
click or tapping outside the sidebar.
