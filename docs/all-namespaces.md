# All Namespaces View

The default view is named "all namespaces" and shows all discovered namespaces,
organized along the hierarchy of user namespaces ❶. The number next to the title
"Linux Namespaces" indicates to number of namespaces shown.

This view reflects the architectural design of the Linux namespaces, where any
namespace is always owned by a user namespace. In case of user namespaces owning
user namespaces this is also the parent-child relationship.

lxkns shows for each user namespace ❶ the "most senior" process with its name
and PID ❷, as well as the user ID and user name to which this user namespace
belongs. The "most senior" process is also termed the "ealdorman"; it is the
topmost *and oldest* process in the process tree that is still attached to the
user namespace.

Now, there might be groups of processes attached to the user namespace with
different cgroup controllers ❸, ❹. These are additionally listed as to not miss
such different "tenants".

> [!NOTE] The init process with PID 1 is always shown first, while all other
> "tenants" are sorted by their process names. Additionally, PID 1 is marked
> with a golden crown icon.

Those namespaces ❸ created at system start are called "initial namespaces".
These are visually marked by dashed borders to make them easily spottable.

Other tenants ❹ might either use some or all of the existing namespaces ("shared
namespaces") or newly created namespaces instead. In case a namespace is
"shared" it is shown washed out. "Reused" namespaces can be hidden in the
[settings](#settings).
