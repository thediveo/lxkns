# Discovery Refresh

The user interface defaults to manual refresh: clicking or tapping ➊ will start
a new discovery. If the discovery takes more time (such as on a system under
heavy load) or in case of a slow connection a progress indicator automatically
appears after approximately one second.

> [!NOTE] Discoveries cause some load on the target system, so please opt for
> either on-demand manual refreshes or choose a more relaxed refresh interval.

Clicking or tapping ➋ opens a pop-up menu to either disable any automatic
refreshing or to choose from a set of available refresh intervals (500ms, 1s,
5s, 10s, 30s, 1min, 5min).
