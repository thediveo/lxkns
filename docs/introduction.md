## Abstract

**lxkns**[^1] discovers Linux-kernel namespaces and how they are used by
processes and threads.  In (almost) every nook and cranny of your Linux
hosts[^2]. It then relates the namespaces, processes and threads to containers,
where possible. **lxkns** additionally discovers mount points in mount
namespaces. 

The discovery can be operated as a stand-alone REST service with additional web
UI. Or it can be integrated into system diagnosis tools that need an
unobstructed view on Linux-kernel namespaces.

When it comes to mount namespaces, **lxkns** finds mount points even in
process-less mount namespaces â€“ for instance, as utilized in ["snap"
technology](https://snapcraft.io/docs). This discovery engine even determines
the **visibility of mount points**, taking different forms of **overmounting**
into consideration.

> [!WARNING] Please check [Important Changes](changelog), especially if you
> have been used the API in the past, and not only the service.

## Quick Deploy

Make sure that you have a fairly recent Docker engine installed, including the
Docker compose plugin. (Debian users are advised to install docker-ce packages
instead of Debian's outdated docker.io ones).

```bash
# I feel lucky!
wget -q -O - \
  https://github.com/thediveo/lxkns/raw/master/deployments/wget/docker-compose.yaml \
  | docker compose -f - up
```

This loads a suitable Docker composer deployment file and feeds it directly into
`docker compose`, deploying the `ghcr.io/thediveo/lxkns` multi-architecture
container image. Supported architectures are amd64 and arm64.

## Eye Candy

The lxkns service provides a web user interface for comfy discovery. Run `make
deploy` and then point your web browser to `http://localhost:5010` after the
service has been successfully deployed.

## In a Nutshell

**lxkns** is...

- a Go module for discovering **namespaces** and **mount points**, with the
  ability to relate namespaces to **containers**,
- a Go package for **switching namespaces** (including safely returning),
- another Go package for **directly(!) reading from other mount namespaces**
  using ordinary file operations,
- a **REST API discovery service** returns JSON discovery results, with an
  additional **web-based user interface** as the icing on top,
- a set of **CLI tools**, as well as our `lsns`-on-drugs example in
  `examples/lsallns` that lists *all* namespaces with their corresponding
  *containers*.

#### Notes

[^1]: The name **lxkns** derives from **L**inu**x** **k**ernel
      **n**ame**sp**aces. Simply naming it "namespaces" instead would have been
      a too generic name. And Go is *very* opinionated when it comes to module
      names that are "too long", "too generic", or "not generic" enough. Alice must
      have gone down a Gopher hole, Lewis Caroll didn't got that part right.

[^2]: Michael Kerrisk of "The Linux Programming Interface" and
    [man7.org](https://man7.org) fame nudged me on my claim enough so that
    **lxkns** as of v0.24 finally got the missing task discovery support.
