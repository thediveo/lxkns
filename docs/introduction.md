## Abstract

**lxkns**[^1] discovers Linux-kernel namespaces as well as mount points in mount
namespaces. It then relates them to containers, where possible. In (almost)
every nook and cranny of your Linux hosts.

This discovery can be operated as a stand-alone REST service with additional web
UI. Or it can be integrated into system diagnosis tools that need an
unobstructed view on Linux-kernel namespaces.

When it comes to mount namespaces, **lxkns** finds mount points even in
process-less mount namespaces â€“ for instance, as utilized in ["snap"
technology](https://snapcraft.io/docs). Our discovery engine even determines the
**visibility of mount points**, taking different forms of **overmounting** into
consideration.

> [!WARNING] Please check [Important Changes](changelog), especially if you
> have been used the API in the past, and not only the service.

## Eye Candy

The lxkns service provides a web user interface for comfy discovery.

## In a Nutshell

**lxkns** is...

- a Go module for discovering **namespaces** and **mount points**, with the
  ability to relate namespaces to **containers**,
- a Go package for **switching namespaces** (including safely returning),
- a **REST API discovery service** return JSON discovery results with an
  additional **web-based user interface** on top,
- a set of **CLI tools**, such as our `lsns`-on-drugs example in
  `examples/lsallns` that lists *all* namespaces with their corresponding
  *containers*.

  NAMESPACE  TYPE   CONTAINER     PID     PROCESS         COMMENT

#### Notes

[^1]: The name **lxkns** derives from **L**inu**x** **k**ernel
      **n**ame**sp**aces. Simply naming it "namespaces" instead would have been
      a too generic name. And Go is *very* opinionated when it comes to module
      names that are too long, too generic, or not generic enough. Alice must
      have gone down a Gopher hole, Lewis Caroll didn't got that part right.
