# Namespace Type Views

The type-specific namespace views show only namespaces for a single specific
type. Most of these views are flat views, except for PID and user namespace
views. The type of namespaces shown is also indicated by the title in the
application bar. The number badge shows the number of namespaces found of this
specific type.

Most types of namespaces are flat without any hierarchy, such as network
namespaces. That is, there aren't network namespaces inside other network
namespaces.
