# Mount Point Discovery

In mount namespaces, lxkns discovers the **mount point hierarchy** from
`mountinfo` in procfs. It then not only derives the VFS mount **path hierarchy**
from this information, but determines also mount point **visibility**.

## Point and Path Hierarchies

The mount point hierarchy is separate from the mount path hierarchy:

- the mount **path hierarchy** is the tree of mount points along **VFS paths**.
  At any given VFS path name there might be none, one, or even several mount
  points (see "overmounts" below). This hierarchy answers the question: "which
  mount(s) are at a specific path?".

- the mount **point hierarchy** is the tree of mount points as managed by the
  Linux kernel and reflects both the history and hierarchy of mounts.

As the Linux kernel only returns the mount point hierarchy, lxkns runs a
slightly involved process in order to determine the correct visibility of mount
points.

## Overmounts and Visibility

Mount points can become hidden (invisible) when getting "overmounted":

- in-place overmount: another mount point at the same mount path as a previous
  mount point hides the former mount point. It is even possible to bind-mount a
  mount point onto itself, changing mount options, such as mount point
  propagation, et cetera.

- overmount higher up the mount path: a mount point has a prefix path of another
  mount path and mount point and thus is hidding the latter, including all mount
  points with paths further down the hierarchy below the hidden mount point.

Lxkns also discovers mount points in mount namespaces that currently are
process-less, but that have been bind-mounted into the VFS â€“ one example is the
["snap" technology](https://snapcraft.io/docs) by Canonical.
