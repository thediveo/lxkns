# Containers

While namespace discovery truely is kernel-space territory it often is helpful
to correlate the discovered namespaces with user-space artefacts, and containers
in particular. Without doubt, containers are a dominant showcase of namespace
technology.

The container-related part of **lxkns'** discovery information model has on offer:

- **containers** (as was to be expected),
- their managing container **engines**,
- container **groups**, such as [composer
  projects](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec),
  [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) pods, et cetera. A container can be a
  member of multiple groups at the same time, such as in the "have your cake"
  and "eat your cake" groups (but please don't expect things working in the
  virtual world to also work in reality).

**lxkns** uses these two architectural elements to discover containers and build
the container-related part of its information model:

- **containerizers** adapt lxkns to different container engines, with Docker and
  containerd support coming right out of the box. Multiple container engines can
  be handled simultaneously.

- **decorators** work on the meta information of the discovered containers and
  enhance ("decorate") the information model further with useful information
  about [composer projects](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec),
  [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) pods, and more.

## Containerizers

In **lxkns** parlance, a "containerizer" is tasked with querying one or more
container engines for their (alive) containers. So to say, to containerize
namespaces.

Right out of the box, **lxkns** handles the following container engines
supported by the [whalewatcher](https://github.com/thediveo/whalewatcher)
sibling project:

- Docker
- containerd

Further container engine types can be added, preferably via the whalewatcher
project.

## Decorators

**lxkns** features an extensible decorator plug-in infrastructure leveraging the
[go-plugger](https://github.com/thediveo/go-plugger) sibling project for Go
plugin management (but only using statically compiled-in plugins).

- [composer project](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec) detection,
  based on `com.docker.composer.project` labels.

- Siemens [Industrial Edge](https://github.com/industrial-edge) app and runtime
  detection (which are a "flavor" of composer projects).

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) pod detection:
  - [dockershim](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/kubelet/dockershim),
    based on the esspecially encoded Docker container names.
  - [containerd CRI
    annotations](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/main/pkg/cri),
    based on CRI-specific container labels.
