`lxkns` is a Golang package for discovering Linux kernel namespaces as well as
mount points in mount namespaces. It then relates them to containers, where
possible. In (almost) every nook and cranny of your Linux hosts.

This discovery can be operated as a stand-alone REST service with additional web
UI. Or it can be integrated into system diagnosis tools that need an
unobstructed view on Linux-kernel namespaces.

For mount namespaces, lxkns finds mount points even in process-less mount
namespaces (for instance, as utilized in ["snap"
technology](https://snapcraft.io/docs)). Our discovery engine even determines
the visibility of mount points, taking different forms of "overmounting" into
consideration.

Take a look at the comprehensive [user (and developer)
manual](https://thediveo.github.io/lxkns).

> service.

## Notes

`lxkns` supports versions of Go that are noted by the [Go release
policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy), that is, major
versions _N_ and _N_-1 (where _N_ is the current major version).

## Hacking It

This project comes with comprehensive unit tests, also covering leak checks:

* goroutine leak checking courtesy of Gomega's
  [`gleak`](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/#codegleakcode-finding-leaked-goroutines)
  package.

* file descriptor leak checking courtesy of the
  [@thediveo/fdooze](https://github.com/thediveo/fdooze) module.

> **Note:** do **not run parallel tests** for multiple packages. `make test`
ensures to run all package tests always sequentially, but in case you run `go
test` yourself, please don't forget `-p 1` when testing multiple packages in
one, _erm_, go.
