<Meta title="Introduction" />

This UI style guide introduces and show-cases the UI components of the lxkns web
user interface. At the same time, it also serves as some weird kind of
interactive testbed to see if and how our UI components (hopefully correctly)
render.

## Global Application State Management

For its global state management the lxkns UI react app doesn't use React Redux
but instead [j≈çtai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai). This does not only
encompass the settings but also the discovery interval and result. The rationale
here is that React Redux cannot handle the discovery data model with loops (that
is, references going forth and back between namespaces and processes).

- show/hide system processes, as well as further data display customization.
- light/dark theme.
- discovery interval (value or null=off) and result.
