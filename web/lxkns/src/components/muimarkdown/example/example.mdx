# Example Markdown

This is an example markdown file which gets compiled into MDX.

- proper ellipsis...

- correct "typographic quotes" and possessive's (ouch, for demonstration
  purposes only :face_palm:).

- range endashes 0-1.

- emdashes -- but sadly not endashes.

## Header Level 2

### Header Level 3

Some text.

### Another Header Level 3

With some other text.

#### Header 4

#### Header 5

Who writes such documents?

## Tables

Tables always need headers, as otherwise the parser won't detect them.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| cell 1 | cell 2 -- get me out of here! |
| cell x | cell y |
