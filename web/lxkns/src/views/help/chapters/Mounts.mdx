# Mount Namespaces

Linux [mount namespaces partition the mount
points](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html) seen by
the processes in a particular mount namespace. **lxkns** shows these mount point
views in its mount namespace view, such as in this example:

<Example states={[[expandInitiallyAtom, true]]}>
  <NamespaceProcessTree
    type="mnt"
    discovery={discovery}
    details={MountTreeDetailer}
  />
</Example>

As a special feature, **lxkns** also shows the mount points inside bind-mounted
namespaces to which no process has been attached (kind of
[findmnt(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/findmnt.8.html) on drugs).

Each mount point is shown with its (shortened) path, type of filesystem, visibility
state (grayed-out, crossed-out), and optional propagation state information (see below). 

### Mount Point Visibility

Multiple mount points can be mounted on the same mount path, but only at most one
of them can be visible in the virtual filesystem view (VFS). The other mount points are
also said to be "overmounted". Moreover, later mount points higher up the VFS path
hierarchy can also hide (overmount) other mount points.

**lxkns** automatically determines the visibility of mount points itself, as
unfortunately the Linux kernel does not explicitly expose visibility information
for mount points. Hidden (overmounted) mount points are grayed-out and their
path crossed out.

### Mount Point Propagation

Simply spoken, mount and unmount events directly below a mount point can optionally
propagate between mount namespaces, see also
[mount namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html#top_of_page)
for the gory details.

The general propagation is indicated after each mount point using one or more
symbols, the number after each icons represents the so-called propagation group
identifier.

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| <PeerIcon/> | mount events propagate between "peer" mounts, all well as unidirectional to "slave" mounts – but any mount events under the slave mounts won't ever propagate back. |
| <SlaveIcon/> | mount events propagate from "master" mounts to this slave mount, but any mount events under this slave mount never propagate back. |
| <UnbindableIcon/> | this mount point cannot be bind-mounted (that is, it cannot be used in other bind mounts). It can still be overmounted, though. |

### Mount Point Details

Clicking on &#32;<MoreHorizIcon className="icon"/> shows more detailed information about a
particular mount point, such as mount and superblock options, the root path, et cetera.

The details additionally show the related "peer", "slave", and "master" mount points
sharing mount events with the mount point, neatly organized by mount namespace.

- peer mounts exchange mount events with each other,
- master mounts send mount events to this mount, but this mount won't send any
  mount events back.
- slave mounts receive mount events from this mount, but won't send any mount
  events back to it.
