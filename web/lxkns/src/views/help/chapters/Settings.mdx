# Settings

## Appearance

Switch the **UI theme** between:

- light theme,

- dark theme,

- either light or dark theme based on user preference – only some web browsers
  support this feature, depending on desktop integration.

## Display

### System Processes

Show or hide **system processes**, where system processes are processes
belonging to one of the following cgroups (control groups):

- `/system.slice/*`
- `/init.scope/*`
- `/user.slice`

Defaults to hiding system processes in order to reduce the amount of process
information.

### Shared Namespaces

Show or hide **shared non-user namespaces**: these are namespaces that are used
– "shared" – by multiple leader processes (and their subprocesses) with
different cgroup controllers but the same owning user namespace.

Defaults to showing all non-user namespaces of a leader process, regardless of
whether a namespace is unique to that leader process, or not. 

### Expand Newly Discovered Namespaces

Automatically expand all newly discovered namespaces, or leave them collapsed.

### Expand Newly Discovered containers

Automatically expand all newly discovered containers, showing the container's
namespaces, or leave them collapsed. This also applies to the initial discovery.
