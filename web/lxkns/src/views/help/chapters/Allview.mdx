# All View

This "home" display shows all discovered [namespaces](/help/namespaces),
organized along the hierarchy of the so-called user namespaces. For example:

<Example>
  <UserNamespaceTree discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

> **Note:** this display is user-configurable in some aspects, such as
> whether to automatically expand newly discovered namespaces.
> See [settings](/help/settings) for more information.

### Initial Namespaces

As the Linux kernel initializes, it creates a set of so-called "initial"
namespaces: these are indicated by dashed borders around their namespace
"badges". For instance:

<Example maxWidth="16em">
  <NamespaceExample type="user" initial={true} />
</Example>

### Number of Child User Namespaces

When user namespaces have child user namespaces, then the total number of child
and grandchild user namespaces is shown right after a user namespace "badge".

### Container Processes

In case a process that is "attached" to a namespace is also associated with a
container then lxkns will first show the name of the container associated with
the particular leader processes.

If a container happens to be part of some types of groups, then these group
names will be shown after the container name. These groups are recognized in the
user interface:

- Docker/nerdctl composer projects,
- Kubernetes pods.

### "Leader" Processes

Often, multiple (well, _many_) processes are "attached" to (using) the same
namespace. Instead of showing the complete mess, lxkns partitions the attached
processes into groups and shows only the "leader process" for each group.
Grouping is done based on the process tree: a leader process is the topmost
process in the process tree still attached to the same namespace as its
children.

If processes attached to the same namespace are controlled by different CPU
cgroups (using different cpu cgroup paths), then lxkns divides them into
separate groups, based on the cgroup paths found.

Additionally, the "freezer" cgroup state is also shown: a <Pause
className="icon"/> paused process is said to be "frozen" in Linux, while a
&#32;<PlayArrow className="icon"/> running process is also said to be "thawed".

### Owned Namespaces

Non-user namespaces as well as child user namespaces are shown indented and
beneath the particular user namespace that is owning them. "Owning a namespace"
here means that when that namespace was created by a process, the process was
attached to that particular *user* namespace.

### "Shared" Namespaces

When the namespaces owned by a user namespace are attached also to processes other
than the most senior "leader" process of the user namespace, then lxkns will
automatically group the owned namespaces by their leader processes. This helps in
quickly understanding how namespaces relate to leader processes. Now, not every
leader process might use its own namespaces but instead multiple leader processes
might "share" some namespaces between them.

| Display | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| <NamespaceExample type="pid" shared={true} initial={true} /> | namespace created by a most senior leader process and shared with this process. |
| <NamespaceExample type="pid" initial={true} /> | namespace created by most senior leader process and shared with other leader processes. |

lxkns shows all namespaces (except for the user namespace)
for the leader processes with different cgroup paths, but "fades" namespaces
that are the same as the most senior leader process. The display of shared
namespaces can be configured (switched on/off) in the [settings](/help/settings).

> **Note:** For lack of a better word, we term such namespaces "shared", but
> this is our user-land terminology, but not Linux-kernel terminology.
