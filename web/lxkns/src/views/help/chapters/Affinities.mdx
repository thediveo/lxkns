# Core Fancy: Task/Process Affinities

In Linux, processes and individual tasks can be assigned to all or only subsets
of the logical CPUs that are online – even to just a single logical CPU.
Restricting a task or process to execute only on a single or a subset of CPUs is
often termed "pinning".

> **Note:** On purpose, we use the term "core" loosely as a synonym to "CPU".
> However, be aware that this is incorrect loose terminology from the kernel's
> perspective. In the kernel, "core" has specific [topological
> meaning](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cputopology.html),

Pinning tasks to CPUs is actually used en masse by the Linux kernel itself:
several of its so-called "kernel threads" (kthreads) are pinned to single cores,
where these kthreads are present once on each logical CPU. However, there are
also other kernel threads that are free to roam across CPUs. lxkns indicates
kernel threads using a <Tux className="icon" /> icon. 

Another example are Wayland-related tasks of Wayland-aware applications, such as
Firefox. These wayland-related tasks are typically pinned in a weaving pattern
to groups of multiple CPUs, as to distribute load.

The "Core Fancy" view shows a tree, with the currently online CPUs as its first
level, indicated by <CPUIcon className="icon" />.

Below the individual CPUs are the processes and tasks that can be executed on
this particular CPU. This can be either because their affinities _include_ this
specific CPU or they are specifically pinned to this CPU (single affinity).

There are visual clues to help with quickly judging the situation:
- <Pinned className="icon" /> indicates that a task or process can **execute
  only** on this particular CPU, but not on any other CPU.
- <PinnedBelow className="icon" /> signals that there is a task or process
  deeper down the hierarchy that is specifically pinned to this CPU only, or to
  a _subset_ of CPUs (but **cannot** be freely executed on _any_ CPU).
- **semi-transparent** task or process information shows that a particular
  process can execute on _any_ CPU, including this particular CPU.
- grayed-out task or process information signals that a process **can't
  execute** on this CPU but is included as a result of the process hierarchy.

**Double clicking on a process node** expands all those process child and
grandchild nodes that are in line to a pinned process or task.
