# <RefreshIcon className="icon"/> Discovery/Refresh

If you don't see any namespace information yet, simply manually refresh the
display using the &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> button in the application
bar. Do not use your browser's refresh button.

Rest assured, this just starts the app-internal new discovery process and does
not reload the web application itself. As soon as the discovery result becomes
available, the display will update automatically. A circling throbber will
appear around the &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> refresh button whenever
discovery takes more time, in order to notify you of an ongoing discovery.

> **Note:** in case of podman, the first discovery can take a few seconds to
> fully complete. The reason is that the default podman system setup is to run
> podman – both as a system service, as well as user-specific services – only on
> demand. The initial discovery thus first needs to start
> (["socket-activate"](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/socket_activation.md))
> all found podman instances and then synchronize to their container workloads.
> This is considerably slower than synchronizing with an already warmed-up
> Docker or Kubernetes CRI-supporting engines. 

## Automatic Refresh Interval

Alternatively, if you hate clicking refresh buttons, you can also set an
automatic refresh interval using the
&#32;<BoxedIcons><SyncIcon/><ExpandMoreIcon/></BoxedIcons> menu. However, please bear
in mind that discoveries are putting some load on your host, so please opt for
slower refresh intervals.
