# <RefreshIcon className="icon"/> Discovery/Refresh

If you don't see any namespace information yet, simply manually refresh the
display using the &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> button in the application
bar. Do not use your browser's refresh button.

Rest assured, this just starts the app-internal new discovery process and does
not reload the web application itself. As soon as the discovery result becomes
available, the display will update automatically. A circling throbber will
appear around the &#32;<RefreshIcon className="icon"/> refresh button whenever
discovery takes more time, in order to notify you of an ongoing discovery.

## Automatic Refresh Interval

Alternatively, if you hate clicking refresh buttons, you can also set an
automatic refresh interval using the
&#32;<BoxedIcons><SyncIcon/><ExpandMoreIcon/></BoxedIcons> menu. However, please bear
in mind that discoveries are putting some load on your host, so please opt for
slower refresh intervals.
