# Namespaces

The Linux-kernel defines a fixed set of namespace _types_; the list of types has
slowly grown over time. This set is fixed for a particular compiled kernel and
cannot be changed or extended while a kernel runs.

## Types

| Type | Structure | Resource Partioning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <NamespaceExample type="cgroup" /> | flat | partitions the root directory of cgroup controllers in the file system. [cgroup_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroup_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="ipc" /> | flat | partitions SYSV inter-process communication and POSIX message queues. [ipc_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="mnt" /> | flat | partitions file system mount points. [mount_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="net" /> | flat | partitions network stacks with their interfaces, addresses, ports, et cetera. [network_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="pid" /> | hierarchical | partitions process identifiers (PIDs); this is a hierarchical namespace type, so processes in a parent PID namespace see all processes in child PID namespaces, but not vice versa. [pid_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="user" /> | hierarchical | partitions user and group identifiers (UIDs, GIDs); this is a nested namespace type, so a particular user namespace is affected by the chain of parent user namespaces. [user_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="uts" /> | flat | partitions the host name and NIS domain name; the type name "uts" stems from the term "Unix time sharing". [uts_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/uts_namespaces.7.html) |
| <NamespaceExample type="time" /> | flat | since Linux 5.6, partitions the boot and monotonic clocks. [time_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time_namespaces.7.html) |

## Identification

Linux-kernel namespaces do **not** have names.

For identifying individual namespaces, Lxkns follows the textual representation
used throughout the Linux kernel, for instance, when executing "`ls -l
/proc/self/ns/net`": the type of namespace, followed by the inode number of the
namespace. The identifier of a namespace is constant only during its lifetime
and can be recycled at any time afterwards.

## Flat Versus Hierarchy

Most types of the Linux kernel namespaces are **flat** – another example of
weird pinguin humor. For example, two network namespaces do not have any
relationship.

Only **PID** and **user** namespaces always form hierarchies, with their
"initial" PID and user namespaces forming the roots. It's not possible to create
a *new root* PID or user namespace.

## Processes

Processes are always attached (or "joined") to exactly one namespace of each
type – unless a particular Linux kernel doesn't support the specific type of
namespace. It is impossible for a process to not being attached to a particular
type of namespace when the Linux kernel supports that type; processes cannot
detach from namespaces.

However, given enough privileges ("capabilities"), processes can switch between
namespaces; subject to some further restrictions based on the type of namespace.

## Initial Namespaces

The so-called "initial namespaces" are created automatically by the Linux kernel
itself when it starts. Initial namespaces are represented using a dashed border
like this in order to make them easily identifiable: <NamespaceExample
type="net" initial={true} />.

> Certain system operations can be carried out only in initial namespaces and
  are blocked in other non-initial namespaces.

## Namespace Lifetime

Linux kernel namespaces exist as long as they are "used", or more precisely,
referenced at least in one of the following ways:

- at least one process is attached ("joined") to the namespace,

- the namespace has been bind-mounted,

- the namespace is referenced by an open file descriptor of a process,

- the PID or user namespace has at least one child namespace that still exists.
  
  > lxkns shows a <Ghost fontSize="inherit"/> in this case, when no other kind
  of reference exists and the PID/user namespace is kind of "hidden" inside the
  namespace hierarchy.

## ...and Containers?

Namespaces and containers are separate concepts:

- namespaces are first-class Linux-kernel elements.

- containers are user-space constructs, which vary in what types of namespaces
  they use, or if they use namespaces at all. The Linux kernel doesn't know
  anything about containers.
