This app displays [Linux-kernel
namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html) discovered
by the lxkns service deployed to a Linux host. These [namespaces](namespaces)
partition certain kinds of Linux resources (such as the file system, processes,
network interfaces), so that processes that are members of a particular
namespace only see these resources isolated in that namespace.

Namespaces can be either displayed in an all-inclusive view (the "all
namespaces" view), or filtered for each type of namespace individually.

In a weird twist of penguin logic, "namespaces" actually do not have any names.
Historically, the first type of namespace in Linux was the "mount" namespace
which is about system paths and partitioning mount points ... and this is where
the meaning of namespace actually originates from.

Please follow now our tour through lxkns by clicking on the "REFRESH&nbsp;>"
button at the end of this text. You can also freely navigate between the help
chapters using the chapter navigation button <TocIcon className="icon" /> in the
top right of this chapter.
