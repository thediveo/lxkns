# Containers

## Containers View

**lxkns** features a dedicated "all containers" view, accessible from the
[application bar drawer](/help/appbar), either by sliding from the left border
or clicking/tapping the <MenuIcon className="icon"/> button in the top-left
corner.

<Example>
  <ContainerTree discovery={discovery} />
</Example>

Yes, you're seeing this example correctly: there are multiple Docker engines –
it's a codespace where the host has its Docker engine. This host Docker runs a
devcontainer that in turns runs its own Docker-in-Docker. The **lxkns** service
has been deployed to this "inner" Docker instance, and there's also another
container for demonstration purposes (that has been pinned to the second logical
CPU, but no other).

## Container (Engine) Types

As **lxkns** detects container engines and their container workloads
automatically, it shows a container symbol next to processes belonging to
containers. The exact symbol depends on the type of container the process
belongs to.

| Symbol | Type of Container |
| --- | --- |
| <Docker/> | [Docker](https://docker.com)/[Moby](https://https://mobyproject.org/) |
| <DockerPlugin/> | Docker managed plugin |
| <CRI/> | CRI (Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface) |
| <Podman/> | [podman](https://podman.io) – notice that we cannot detect podman user instances unless they are systemd-activated. This is a principal architectural issue of podman.  |
| <IERuntime/> | Siemens Industrial Edge runtime |
| <Container/> | unknown container type |

## Container Groups

Some containers may be "grouped"; **lxkns** then shows different symbols
depending on the type of container group, together with the group name.

| Symbol | Type of Container Group |
| --- | --- |
| <ComposerProject/> | (Docker) [compose](https://compose-spec.io/) project |
| <IEApp/> | Siemens Industrial Edge App |
| <K8sPod/> | Kubernetes Pod |

> **Note:** **lxkns** supports only the Docker-compatible functionality of
> podman. Podman pods are neither discovered nor shown. We will not support the
> podman-specific API, because of the negative experience gained in the
> now-archived [sealwatcher](https://github.com/thediveo/sealwatcher) podman
> watcher project.

## Development Containers

Some containers may be used as development containers, sometimes as part of a
GitHub codespaces.

| Symbol | Type of Container Group |
| --- | --- |
| <DevContainer/> | [development container](https://containers.dev/) |
| <Codespace/> | development container as part of a [Github codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) |
