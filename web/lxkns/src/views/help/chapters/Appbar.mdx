# Application Bar

The "Application Bar" sits at the top of the web user interface page. It
consists of the following elements...

## <MenuIcon className="icon"/>/<ChevronLeftIcon className="icon"/> Open/Close the Drawer

The <MenuIcon className="icon"/> button in the application bar opens the
(navigation) drawer. When opened, the drawer shows a <ChevronLeftIcon
className="icon"/> close button to dismiss the drawer.

The drawer allows switching between different views and also provides access to
[settings](/help/settings) and information about this application. The first two
sections in the drawer relate specifically to showing Linux kernel namespaces
from different perspectives. The last but one section shows [process affinities
for CPUs](/help/affinities).

## <Badge badgeContent="42" color="secondary">Namespaces</Badge>

The number badge in the application bar displays the number of namespaces
currently shown.

## <ChevronRightIcon className="icon"/> Expand Top-Level Only

The <ChevronRightIcon className="icon"/> button collapses the view except for
the top-level namespace(s) and the attached (cgroup'ed) leader processes.

## <ExpandMoreIcon className="icon"/> Expand All

The <ExpandMoreIcon className="icon"/> button expands all namespaces with all
their attached (cgroup'ed) leader processes.

## <span style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}><RefreshIcon className="icon"/><BoxedIcons><SyncIcon/><ExpandMoreIcon/></BoxedIcons></span> Refresh

The remaining application bar buttons are for [refreshing the discovery data as
well as controlling the refresh interval](/help/refresh).
