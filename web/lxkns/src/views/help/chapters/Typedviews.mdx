# Type-Specific Views

The type-specific namespace views show namespaces just of a single specific
type. Then, they are mostly _flat_ views, except for PID and user namespace
views. For instance, this is a view into only _user_ namespaces, now _without_
the owned namespaces:

<Example>
  <NamespaceProcessTree type="user" discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

And this is an example view into only _mount_ namespaces:

<Example>
  <NamespaceProcessTree type="mnt" discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

Please note that mount namespaces additionally show their mount points, see
[mount namespaces](/help/mounts) for details.

### Cgroup Grouping

In case the processes attached to a namespace belong to different cgroup
controller paths, then additionally all the leader (topmost) processes in the process
tree with differing cgroup paths are shown. This is especially usefull in such
cases, where containers share namespaces (either with other containers or the
host). Such as in case of our "lxkns" service container that needs its processes
to run attached to the host's initial PID namespace for correct namespace
discovery:

<Example>
  <NamespaceProcessTree type="pid" discovery={discovery} action={{ action: "" }} />
</Example>

### Initial Namespaces

As the Linux kernel initializes, it creates a set of so-called "initial"
namespaces: these are indicated by dashed borders around their namespace
"badges". For instance:

<Example maxWidth="16em">
  <NamespaceExample type="net" initial={true} />
</Example>


### Number of Child User/PID Namespaces

When user or PID namespaces have child user namespaces, then the total number of
child and grandchild namespaces is shown right after a namespace "badge".

### Container Processes

In case a process that is "attached" to a namespace is also associated with a
container then lxkns will first show the name of the container associated with
the particular leader processes.

If a container happens to be part of some types of groups, then these group
names will be shown after the container name. These groups are recognized in the
user interface:

- Docker/nerdctl composer projects,
- Kubernetes pods.

### "Leader" Processes

Often, multiple (well, _many_) processes are "attached" to (using) the same
namespace. Instead of showing the complete mess, lxkns partitions the attached
processes into groups and shows only the "leader process" for each group.
Grouping is done based on the process tree: a leader process is the topmost
process in the process tree still attached to the same namespace as its
children.

If processes attached to the same namespace are controlled by different CPU
cgroups (using different cpu cgroup paths), then lxkns divides them into
separate groups, based on the cgroup paths found.

Additionally, the "freezer" cgroup state is also shown: a <Pause
className="icon"/> paused process is said to be "frozen" in Linux, while a
&#32;<PlayArrow className="icon"/> running process is also said to be "thawed".

### Loose Threads

Loose threads – for lack of better official terminology – are Linux OS-level
threads (that is, _non-process_ tasks) that are attached to at least some
namespaces that differ from the namespaces a thread's process is attached to. In
particular, these threads might keep namespace references that no other process
yet has attached to.
