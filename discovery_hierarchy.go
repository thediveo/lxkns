// Discovers the hierarchy of user and PID namespaces using Linux kernel

// mounted references. Most importantly, only we get the correct hierarchical
// information in this discovery phase.
//
// This discovery must be run late, so that any bind-mounted or fd'ed user and
// pid leaf namespaces were found by now, because we cannot find them here,
// due to the way the Linux kernel exposes the user/PID namespaces hierarchy:
// only given a child namespace, we can then query its parent namespace. But
// we cannot query a parent namespace for all its children.

// discoverHierarchy unmasks the hierarchy of user and PID namespaces. All
// other types of Linux kernel namespaces don't form hierarchies within their
// type. (This simplifies ownership relations to not be hierarchical, as your
// cats surely will testify to with greatest pleasure.)
//
// For user namespaces, this also discovers the owner's UID; the rationale is
// that this is the most efficient way to do it, otherwise we would need to
// retraverse the hierarchy for all user namespaces again during discovering
// the overall ownership relations. The problem with a later discovery is that
// hidden namespaces don't have file paths as references but instead can only
// be referenced by fd's returned by the kernel namespace ioctl()s. This would
// then force us to keep potentially a larger number of fd's open.
