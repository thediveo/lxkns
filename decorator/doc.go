/*
Package decorator defines the [Decorate] plug-in interface, where the so-called
“decorators” adorn the container information model with additional data, such
as container grouping and unified pod-related container labels.

Sub-packages contain specific decorators for (Docker) composer groups,
Kubernetes pod (groups), et cetera.
